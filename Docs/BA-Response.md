**Suggested Questions:**
1. **Regarding Client Company Admins:** * "Raj, you mentioned client company admins creating profiles for plants/departments. Can you give me a few examples of how these plants/departments might be structured differently across your client base? This will help us understand the variability we need to accommodate." * "What level of access control do you need beyond plant/department? Are there any other organizational units or security considerations we should account for?" * "How will admin users be managed? What's the process for adding, removing, or changing permissions for these users?" 2. **Regarding Auditing Company Access:** * "Ananya, you mentioned access control based on assigned plant/department. What happens if an auditing company needs access to data across multiple plants or departments? How will this be managed?" * "What specific data points are being shared with the auditing companies? Can you provide a data dictionary or example datasets?" * "What are the security and compliance requirements for data access and sharing with external auditing companies? (e.g., data encryption, audit trails)" 3. **Regarding the Dashboard and Audit Status:** * "Prakash, the dashboard sounds useful. Can you elaborate on what constitutes 'Under Review'? What actions trigger a change in status? This will help define the workflow." * "Beyond the statuses you mentioned, are there any other key metrics or information that should be displayed on the dashboard for admins and/or auditing companies?" * "Who is responsible for updating the audit status? Will this be automated, or will it require manual intervention?" 4. **Regarding Audit Teams and Roles:** * "Raj, you described 'Audit Team' and roles. Can you provide a more detailed description of the responsibilities and permissions associated with each role (Lead Auditor, Field Inspector, Reviewer)? This will help us define the access control matrix." * "What happens if a team member leaves the project? What's the process for managing role changes within the audit team?" 5. **Regarding Real-time Updates for Plant Managers:** * "Siddharth, the real-time updates for plant managers are a valuable addition. What level of granularity is needed? Do they need to see individual inspection point details, or a summary view?" * "How frequently should these real-time updates be refreshed? What is the acceptable latency for these updates?" * "What actions can plant managers take based on these real-time updates? Will they be able to make changes or just monitor progress?" 6. **Underlying Business Goals:** * "Overall, what are the key business goals this system is intended to achieve? How will we measure the success of this system?" * "What are the biggest pain points currently experienced in the audit process that this system aims to solve?" * "What are the potential risks if this system is not implemented correctly or doesn't meet expectations?"

**Suggested Questions:**
* **Regarding Real-time Updates & Role-Based Access (Siddharth & Ananya):** * "Siddharth, can you give me some examples of how real-time access to inspection point statuses would improve efficiency or decision-making for the plant manager? What are the potential consequences of *not* having this real-time visibility?" * "Ananya, you mentioned role-based access. Can you elaborate on the different user roles and their specific permissions within the system? Are there any other roles beyond Plant Manager and Plant User that we need to consider?" * "What is the acceptable latency for these real-time updates? How often do inspection point statuses typically change, and what is the critical threshold for delay before information becomes stale?" * "What mechanisms are currently in place for tracking inspection point statuses, and what are the limitations of the current system?" * **Regarding the Re-auditing Workflow (Meera & Raj):** * "Raj, can you describe a typical scenario where an inspection point requires repair? What are the common reasons for rejection?" * "What's the acceptable timeframe for repairing and re-auditing a point? Are there any Service Level Agreements (SLAs) involved?" * "How will the system handle situations where a repaired point still fails re-verification? What's the escalation process?" * "How will we track the time spent on repair and re-auditing? Is this data important for reporting or analysis?" * **Regarding Push Notifications & Audit Logs (Prakash & Siddharth):** * "Prakash, what types of notifications are most crucial? Should we prioritize certain status changes over others? What devices should the notifications be sent to (e.g., mobile phones, desktops)?" * "Siddharth, regarding compliance, what specific regulations or standards mandate audit logs? What level of detail is required in these logs (e.g., timestamp, user ID, IP address)?" * "How will we manage notification overload? Will users be able to customize their notification preferences?"
