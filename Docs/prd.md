Hereâ€™s a Product Requirements Document (PRD) drafted specifically for your AI agent-driven transcript analysis application. It is structured in a clear, modular format so that it can directly guide an AI coding assistant (like GitHub Copilot, Claude, or even a fine-tuned AI agent).

ðŸ“„ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project Title: AI Role-Playing Transcript Analyser - DoppelgÃ¤nger AI
Version: 1.0 MVP

â¸»

1. Overview

We are building an AI-powered application that analyzes pre-made meeting transcripts. Based on a pre-defined role (e.g., Business Analyst, Startup Founder), the AI agent will:
 â€¢ Ask intelligent, context-aware follow-up questions.
 â€¢ Suggest relevant conversational statements based on the transcript content.
The AI should analyze the transcript in chunks and maintain the context throughout the dialogue suggestions.

â¸»

2. Goals
 â€¢ Build a backend system that:
 â€¢ Accepts a transcript file (text or JSON format).
 â€¢ Chunks the transcript into manageable sizes (~1000 tokens per chunk).
 â€¢ Sequentially processes chunks using LangChain and Gemini Pro API.
 â€¢ Generates role-specific:
 â€¢ Follow-up questions.
 â€¢ Relevant statements to drive the conversation forward.
 â€¢ Build a simple frontend interface to:
 â€¢ Upload transcripts.
 â€¢ Select the role/persona (e.g., Business Analyst, Founder).
 â€¢ Display the AIâ€™s generated questions/statements.

3. User Stories

As aâ€¦ I want toâ€¦ So thatâ€¦
Business Analyst Get AI-generated questions from a transcript I can explore deeper client requirements
Startup Founder Receive AI-suggested statements and queries I can engage investors effectively
Product User Upload transcripts and select AI roles I can get tailored conversational prompts

4. Functional Requirements

4.1. Transcript Handling
 â€¢ Accept transcript as a plain text or JSON file.
 â€¢ Chunk transcript into manageable segments (~1000 tokens per chunk).

4.2. AI Processing Engine
 â€¢ Use LangChain Sequential Chain or Map-Reduce Chain to:
 â€¢ Analyze each chunk.
 â€¢ Generate context-specific questions/statements.
 â€¢ Maintain the AIâ€™s persona via system prompts.
 â€¢ Integrate with Google Gemini Pro API via API Key (programmatic access).

4.3. Role Management
 â€¢ Supported roles:
 â€¢ Business Analyst
 â€¢ Startup Founder
 â€¢ Role-specific prompt templates must guide the AI behavior.

4.4. Frontend Interface
 â€¢ File upload functionality.
 â€¢ Role selection dropdown.
 â€¢ Display area for AI-generated:
 â€¢ Questions.
 â€¢ Statements.

â¸»

5. Non-Functional Requirements
 â€¢ Fast response time per chunk (<5 seconds ideally).
 â€¢ Basic UI for MVP (can use React, Next.js, or plain HTML/JS).
 â€¢ API key must be securely stored in the backend.
 â€¢ System should handle large transcripts by splitting and processing sequentially.
