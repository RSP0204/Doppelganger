╰───────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ You can find the ffprobe command as part of
  the FFmpeg suite of tools. If you don't have
  it installed, you'll need to install FFmpeg
  first.

  How to Install FFmpeg (and ffprobe) on 
  Windows:

  The easiest way to install FFmpeg on Windows
  is by downloading a pre-built executable.


   1. Download FFmpeg:
       * Go to the official FFmpeg download
         page: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
          (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
       * Click on the Windows icon.
       * Under "Windows builds from gyan.dev"
         (or similar), click on the link to
         download the ffmpeg-git-full.7z (or
         similar) file. This is usually a 7-zip
          archive.


   2. Extract FFmpeg:
       * You'll need a program like 7-Zip (if
         you don't have it, download it from
         https://www.7-zip.org/ 
         (https://www.7-zip.org/)) to extract
         the .7z file.
       * Extract the contents of the downloaded
          .7z file to a location on your
         computer. A common place is C:\Program
          Files\ffmpeg or C:\ffmpeg. Let's
         assume you extract it to C:\ffmpeg.
         Inside, you'll find bin, doc,
         licenses, etc. The ffprobe.exe file
         will be in the bin folder (e.g.,
         C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe).


   3. Add FFmpeg to your System PATH 
      (Recommended):
      This step allows you to run ffprobe from
  any directory in your terminal without typing
   the full path.
       * Search for "Environment Variables" in
         the Windows search bar and select
         "Edit the system environment
         variables."
       * Click the "Environment Variables..."
         button.
       * Under "System variables," find and
         select the Path variable, then click
         "Edit...".
       * Click "New" and add the path to your
         FFmpeg bin folder (e.g.,
         C:\ffmpeg\bin).
       * Click "OK" on all windows to close
         them.
       * Restart your terminal (MINGW64) for 
         the changes to take effect.

  How to Run the `ffprobe` Command and Get its 
  Output:

  Once FFmpeg is installed and (optionally)
  added to your PATH:


   1. Open your MINGW64 terminal.
   2. Navigate to the directory where your 
      `dialog-memory.wav` file is located. (If
      you added FFmpeg to PATH, you can run it
      from anywhere, but it's good practice to
      be in the same directory as the audio
      file).
   3. Run the `ffprobe` command:


   1     ffprobe -v error
     -select_streams a:0 -show_entries
     stream=codec_name,sample_rate,cha
     nnels -of
     default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=
     1 "dialog-memory.wav"

ffprobe -v error  -select_streams a:0 -show_entries stream=codec_name,sample_rate,channels -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 "C:/Users/RichaSingh/Downloads/dialog-memory_wav.wav"

       * Important: Make sure dialog-memory.wav
          is in your current directory, or
         provide the full path to it.

  What the Output Will Look Like (and what it 
  means):


  The command is designed to give you three
  lines of output, each representing a key
  property of your audio file:



   1 pcm_s16le  # This is the audio 
     encoding (codec name)
   2 16000      # This is the sample 
     rate in Hertz (Hz)
   3 1          # This is the number 
     of audio channels (1 for mono, 2 
     for stereo)



   * `codec_name` (e.g., `pcm_s16le`): This
     tells us how the audio data is encoded.
     For Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, pcm_s16le
      typically maps to
     RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16.
   * `sample_rate` (e.g., `16000`): This is the
      number of samples per second. You'll use
     this value directly for sample_rate_hertz.
   * `channels` (e.g., `1`): This indicates if
     the audio is mono (1) or stereo (2). While
      not directly used in RecognitionConfig
     for basic transcription, it's good to know
      for debugging.


  Please run this `ffprobe` command and 
  copy-paste its exact output here. This
  information is crucial for correctly
  configuring the RecognitionConfig in
  backend/transcriber.py and resolving the
  silent crash.

   FFmpeg' Is used for what exactly?  │
╰───────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ FFmpeg is a free and open-source project        
  consisting of a vast suite of libraries and     
  programs for handling multimedia data. It's a   
   command-line tool that can record, convert,    
  stream, and play audio and video in virtually   
   any format.

  Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for
  multimedia.

  Here's what FFmpeg is used for, broadly:        


   * Format Conversion: This is one of its most   
      common uses. You can convert video files    
     from MP4 to AVI, audio files from WAV to     
     MP3, or images from PNG to JPG, and
     countless other combinations.
   * Video Editing: Basic editing tasks like      
     cutting, trimming, concatenating,
     rotating, scaling, and adding watermarks     
     to videos.
   * Streaming: It's widely used for live
     streaming, encoding video for web
     delivery, and even for building custom       
     streaming solutions.
   * Audio Manipulation: Extracting audio from    
     video, changing audio volume, mixing audio   
      tracks, and applying various audio
     filters.
   * Screen Recording: Capturing your computer    
     screen and audio.
   * Multimedia Analysis (using `ffprobe`):       
     This is where ffprobe comes in. It's a       
     companion tool to ffmpeg that is
     specifically designed to analyze
     multimedia streams and extract detailed      
     information about them, such as:
       * Codec: The encoding format (e.g.,        
         H.264 for video, AAC for audio, PCM      
         for uncompressed audio).
       * Resolution: Width and height of video.   
       * Frame Rate: How many frames per second   
          a video has.
       * Bitrate: The amount of data per
         second.
       * Sample Rate: For audio, how many
         samples per second.
       * Channels: For audio, whether it's        
         mono, stereo, or surround sound.
       * Duration: The length of the media        
         file.

  Why `ffprobe` is relevant to our current        
  task:


  In our case, we need to provide Google
  Cloud Speech-to-Text with specific details
  about your .wav audio file (like its
  encoding and sample rate) so that it can
  correctly process the audio. If these
  details don't match, the API call will
  fail. ffprobe is the perfect tool to
  accurately get these technical
  specifications from your dialog-memory.wav
  file, allowing us to configure the
  RecognitionConfig in backend/transcriber.py
   correctly.
