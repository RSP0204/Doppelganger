✦ That's a very important and clarifying
  question.

  You must install Python on your system first
  before you can create a virtual environment.

  Here's a simple breakdown of why:


   * Virtual Environment vs. Virtual Machine: A
      Python virtual environment is not a
     virtual machine. A virtual machine (like
     VirtualBox or VMware) emulates an entire
     computer, including the operating system.
     A Python virtual environment, on the other
      hand, is just a lightweight, isolated
     directory that contains a copy of a
     specific Python interpreter.
   * The "Base" Python: The command python -m 
     venv venv relies on an existing Python
     installation on your machine. It finds
     that "base" Python and creates a
     self-contained copy of it inside the venv
     folder for your project to use. Without a
     Python installation on your system, there
     is nothing to copy, and the command will
     fail.
