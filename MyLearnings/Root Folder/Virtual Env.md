✦ You should run pip install -r 
  requirements.txt from the root folder of your
   project: C:/Users/RichaSingh/Doppelganger/.


  This is because the requirements.txt file
  is located directly in the root of your
  Doppelganger directory, not inside the
  backend folder.

╰──────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Yes, it is absolutely correct and, in fact,
  the recommended practice to run pip install 
  -r requirements.txt from the root folder
  (C:/Users/RichaSingh/Doppelganger/).

  Here's why:


   1. Virtual Environment: Your project has a
      .venv directory in the root. When you
      activate this virtual environment (e.g.,
      by running .\.venv\Scripts\activate on
      Windows) and then run pip install -r 
      requirements.txt from the root, all
      dependencies listed in that file are
      installed into that specific virtual 
      environment. This ensures that all parts
      of your project (including the backend
      application) use the same isolated set of
      dependencies.
   2. Project-Wide Dependencies: The
      requirements.txt file typically lists all
      Python dependencies for the entire 
      project, not just a single sub-directory.
      The backend code (in backend/) relies on
      these dependencies, but the
      requirements.txt itself is a project-level
       configuration.
   3. Consistency and Reproducibility:
      Installing from the root ensures that
      anyone setting up the project will install
       the exact same dependencies into the
      project's virtual environment, leading to
      consistent behavior across different
      development machines and deployment
      environments.


  If you were to install it directly within
  the backend folder, it wouldn't necessarily
   use the project's main virtual
  environment, which could lead to dependency
   conflicts or issues where the backend
  can't find the installed libraries.

╰───────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Yes, setting up the virtual environment in
  the root folder
  (C:/Users/RichaSingh/Doppelganger/.venv/) is
  the correct and highly recommended strategy.

  Here's why it's the best practice:


   1. Dependency Isolation: It creates an
      isolated environment for your project's
      Python dependencies. This prevents
      conflicts with other Python projects on
      your system or with your system's global
      Python installation.
   2. Project-Wide Scope: Your backend folder is
       part of the larger Doppelganger project.
      By having the virtual environment at the
      root, all parts of your project (including
       any future scripts or modules outside
      backend) can easily access and use the
      same set of installed dependencies.
   3. Reproducibility: When you share your
      project (e.g., via Git), the
      requirements.txt file in the root,
      combined with the virtual environment
      setup, allows anyone else to easily
      recreate the exact same development
      environment with all necessary
      dependencies.
   4. Standard Practice: This is the widely
      accepted and idiomatic way to manage
      Python project dependencies.


  So, to reiterate, your current setup with
  the virtual environment in the root is
  ideal.
