  Frontend Folder Structure Analysis

  As we discussed, the current structure of
  your frontend folder is perfectly suited for
  a modern Next.js 15 project.


   * `src` directory: It's best practice to
     keep your application code inside a src
     directory to separate it from
     configuration files (like next.config.ts,
     package.json, etc.) in the root.
   * `src/app` directory: This confirms you are
      using the App Router. This is the
     standard for new Next.js applications. All
      your application's pages and layouts will
      be built inside this directory.
   * `src/components` directory: This is the
     ideal place to store your reusable React
     components (e.g., buttons, modals, custom
     UI elements).
   * `src/lib`: This is a conventional place
     for utility functions, helper scripts, or
     library configurations.

  So, the foundation is solid.

  PRD Analysis & Suggested Routes

  I've analyzed the PRD.md file. The core user
  flow is very clear:


   1. A user comes to the application.
   2. They upload a transcript file.
   3. They select an AI persona/role from a
      dropdown.
   4. They see the AI-generated questions and
      statements based on their input.


  Given this flow, the application for the MVP
  (Minimum Viable Product) is essentially a
  single-page tool. Therefore, I would suggest
  a very simple routing structure:

   * `/` (The Root Route): This would be the
     main and only page of your application.
     The file for this page would be located at
      frontend/src/app/page.tsx.


  This single page would contain all the UI
  elements described in the PRD:
   1. A component for uploading the transcript.
   2. A dropdown menu to select the role
      ("Business Analyst," "Startup Founder").
   3. A display area where the results from the
      AI agent are shown.

  Discussion Points:


   * Simplicity: A single-page interface is the
      most direct and user-friendly way to
     implement the requirements of the PRD. It
     keeps the experience clean and focused on
     the core task.
   * Future Expansion: If you were to add more
     features later, you could easily add new
     routes. For example:
       * /history: A page to view past analysis
          results.
       * /settings: A page for user-specific
         settings.
       * /login: If you add user accounts.
   * API vs. Frontend Routes: It's important to
      distinguish between the API endpoints
     listed in the PRD (/upload-transcript,
     /process-transcript) and the frontend 
     routes. The frontend page (/) will call
     these backend API endpoints in the
     background to send the file and get the
     results, but the user will stay on the
     same page in their browser.
